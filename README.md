# Loan Status Prediction

This repository contains code for predicting loan status based on various features using machine learning techniques.


## Task 1: Importing libraries and Exploring the Dataset
The first task involves importing necessary libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, and loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame. Initial exploration of the dataset is performed to understand its structure and features.

## Task 2: Defining Exploratory Data Analysis with an overview of the whole project
This task involves providing an overview of the project and the steps involved in exploratory data analysis.

## Task 3: Checking missing values and Outliers & Creating visual methods to analyze the data
In this task, missing values and outliers in the dataset are identified and handled appropriately. Visual methods are also created to analyze the data distribution.

## Task 4: Feature Selection & Extraction
Feature selection and extraction techniques are applied to identify the most relevant features for the prediction task.

## Task 5: Creating a model that fits the data
Machine learning models are trained on the dataset to predict loan status. Various models can be explored and evaluated for their performance.

## Task 6: Creating an accuracy table
The accuracy of different models is tabulated for comparison.

## Task 7: Applying Grid search for the best Models
Grid search technique is applied to fine-tune hyperparameters of the models and find the best performing model.

## Task 8: Test Script for test data
A test script is created to evaluate the performance of the trained model on unseen test data.

## Usage
To run the code, make sure you have all the necessary libraries installed. You can then execute the code sequentially for each task.

## Additional Notes
- Data preprocessing techniques such as imputation, encoding, and oversampling are applied to prepare the dataset for modeling.
- Visualization techniques are utilized to gain insights into the data distribution and relationships between variables.
- Multiple machine learning algorithms can be explored and compared to identify the most suitable model for predicting loan status.
